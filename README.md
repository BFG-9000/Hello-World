# Hello-World
First test "Hello World" Github repositorty.

I'm a designer and gis specialist at S&ME, Inc., a multi-disciplinary engineering firm located mostly east of the Mississippi, U.S.A.  My experience with developing software is very long, but not very deep.  I've dabbled around the edges and kept fairly familiar with trends in software development since roughly 1984.  With ArcGIS making the transition to Python i've had the ability to get more intimate with the current software ecosystem while not having to work on it for free at home.  With the recent releases of project Malmo and google's free course on machine learning at Udacity I'm planning on getting substatially more involved in coding as having a pet AI at my house is just too cool not to do.
